## Overview

PhysicalStore-Completa is a [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)-based API system for managing physical store locations and shipping calculations. This system enables users to find nearby stores based on a postal code (CEP), retrieve detailed store information, and calculate shipping costs between locations.

### System Purpose

The PhysicalStore-Completa system serves two primary functions:

- Store Location Management: Allows users to find physical stores near a specified location, filter stores by state, and access detailed store information.

- Shipping Calculation: Provides shipping cost calculation between locations, taking into account package dimensions and weight.

### System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular architecture based on the NestJS framework, with a clear separation between controllers, services, and data access layers.

### Key Features

**Store Management**
- Find stores near specified postal code(CEP)
- List stores by state
- Retrieve detailed store information
- Distinguish between "PDV"(points of sale) and "LOJA"(stores with shipping) types

**Shipping Calculaiton**
- Calculate shipping costs between postal codes
- Consider package dimensions and weight in calculations
- Provide multiple shipping ooptions

### Technical Stack

The system is built using the following technologies:

| Component | Technology |
|---------|----------|
| Framework | NestJS |
| Database | SQLite |
| API Documentation | Swagger |
| External Integrations | Google Maps API, ViaCEP API, Melhor Envio API |
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Package Management | npm |

### API Endpoints

The system exposes the following main API endpoints:

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| /lojas | GET | List all stores |
| /lojas/:id | GET | Get stores by id |
| /lojas/por-cep/:cep | GET | Find stores near the given CEP/postal code, if none is found calculate shipping costs from the online store to the CEP/postal code |
| /lojas/por-estado/:estado | GET | Find stores in a specific state |
| /frete | POST | Calculate shipping costs |

### External integrations
The system integrates with 3 external services to provide its functionality:

1. **ViaCEP API**: To convert postal codes to geographic coordinates
2. **Google Maps API**: To calculate the distance between locations
3. **Melhor Envio API**: For shipping cost calculations

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
